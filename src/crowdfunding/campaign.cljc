  "Campaign — the funded thing itself, and the state table that decides
  when money is allowed to move.

  A rewards crowdfunding campaign is not a store listing. The difference
  that matters is TIME: a backer commits to something that does not exist
  yet, at a price fixed today, redeemable at a date the creator estimates.
  Every rule in this library follows from that gap, and the two rules that
  follow from it here are:

  1. **All-or-nothing is a property of the campaign, not of a payment.**
     Under `:all-or-nothing`, no backer is charged unless the goal is met
     at the deadline. That is why `:live -> :collecting` is not an edge in
     this table: a campaign must pass through `:funding-succeeded` (a
     decided outcome) before anything is collectible. Collection cannot be
     reached by accident.
  2. **A suspended campaign has no automatic exit.** `:suspended` is where
     trust-and-safety puts a campaign it believes is misrepresenting
     itself, and the only way out is `reinstate`, which requires a named
     human. An actor that could un-suspend a campaign on its own would
     make suspension worthless.

  Amounts are INTEGER minor units of `:campaign/currency` (yen, cents) —
  never floats, the `kotoba.reji` discipline that `marketplace.settlement`
  also keeps.

  Timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC strings, so lexicographic compare IS
  chronological compare. Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness."

(def funding-models
  "`:all-or-nothing` — nothing is collected unless the goal is met by the
  deadline; the backer's risk is bounded by the creator's own target.
  `:flexible` — the creator keeps whatever was pledged. Both exist in the
  wild; this library refuses to let a campaign be ambiguous about which one
  a backer agreed to, because that ambiguity is the single most common
  crowdfunding dispute."
  #{:all-or-nothing :flexible})

(def pricing-models
  "How the backer's final price is determined.

  `:fixed` — the price is set at pledge time. This is what the category
  means by 'crowdfunding', and it is also, for anything with a bill of
  materials, an unhedged short on the components: the creator fixes a
  price today and buys parts months later. ADR-2607268000 declined it for
  exactly that reason after DDR5 rose 448% in twelve months.

  `:deposit-plus-settlement` — the backer commits a deposit for a build
  slot and a stated margin; the parts cost passes through at settlement,
  bounded by a cap the backer agreed to at pledge time. The commodity risk
  sits with the party that can see the market, and the backer's exposure
  is bounded and stated rather than absorbed by a creator who may not
  survive absorbing it.

  Supporting only `:fixed` would be a platform that cannot express the
  structure this workspace's own hardware campaign chose."

  campaign — it is a longer window in which the estimated delivery date
  ages while nothing is collected. 60 days is the industry ceiling and
  this library keeps it as a hard validation rather than advice."

  how a platform ends up reporting a raise it never actually received."

  - anything out of `:funding-failed`, `:cancelled`, `:completed` — a
    campaign that failed is not re-openable; a new campaign is a new
    campaign, with a new set of consents from its backers.
  - `:collecting -> :funding-failed` IS present, because a campaign whose
    collections all drop off has not, in fact, been funded."
