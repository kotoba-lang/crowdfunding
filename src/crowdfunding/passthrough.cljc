  "Deposit-plus-settlement pricing — the structure a campaign uses when
  its bill of materials is a commodity it has to buy later.

  Fixed-price crowdfunding asks a creator to sell, today, a thing whose
  inputs they will buy in six months. That is an unhedged short on those
  inputs. It is invisible while component prices are flat and it is fatal
  when they are not: ADR-2607268000 declined fixed-price for the Murakumo
  MK-1 after DDR5 rose 448% in twelve months, citing campaigns that
  delivered late, at a loss, or not at all for precisely this reason.

  The alternative this namespace implements moves the risk to the party
  who can see the market, and bounds the backer's exposure:

    charge at deadline  = deposit
    charge at settlement = actual parts cost + fixed margin - deposit
    and never more than  = cap agreed at pledge time

  Three properties make it honest rather than just flexible:

  1. **The cap is agreed up front and enforced here.** A settlement above
     the cap does not silently bill the backer — `settle` marks it
     `:settlement/over-cap?` and computes what the CREATOR absorbs. The
     only way past a cap is `reconsent`, which requires the backer to
     agree to a new one.
  2. **The margin is fixed and stated in the campaign's currency.** It is
     not a percentage of parts cost, because a percentage margin means the
     creator profits from component inflation, which is the incentive that
     makes pass-through pricing untrustworthy.
  3. **Evidence travels with the settlement.** `:settlement/cost-basis`
     names what was bought at what price; a pass-through number with no
     basis is just a higher price with extra steps.

  Amounts are integer minor units of the campaign currency. Pure: no
  clock, no network, no randomness."

  "What a backer agrees to at pledge time under this model.

  `deposit-minor` is charged with everyone else's pledge at the deadline.
  `margin-minor` is the creator's fixed take, in currency, not percent.

  `estimate-minor` is the creator's honest current parts estimate. It is
  carried so that a settlement can be compared against what the backer was
