  "Campaign review — what must be checked before a campaign may take
  money, and where the checking stops.

  This namespace has one function that could be dangerous and is
  deliberately not written: there is no `approve`. `review` produces
  FINDINGS. A finding is an observation with a rule id, a severity and a
  citation; it is not a verdict. Deciding that a campaign may launch is a
  named human's act, recorded by the reviewing actor's governor — the same
  boundary `marketplace.crossborder` keeps for customs disputes.

  The reason is specific to this domain rather than general caution. A
  crowdfunding review is a judgement about whether a stranger can build a
  thing they have not built yet. No rule set decides that. What a rule set
  can do is guarantee that the reviewer was shown the things that most
  often turn out to matter afterwards — an undisclosed risk, a
  prototype-versus-render ambiguity, a goal too large for the creator's
  verification level, a category that is not a project at all. That is
  what these rules are: a floor under human attention, not a substitute
  for it.

  Verification evidence comes from `kotoba-lang/ekyc` and
  `kotoba-lang/aml` outcomes, passed IN. This namespace never performs a
  check, and never treats a self-reported status as evidence — the
  'ground truth, not self-report' rule the whole fleet's governors share.

  Pure: no clock, no network, no randomness."
