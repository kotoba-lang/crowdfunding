  "After the money — surveys, delivery, and the accountability record that
  makes a late project distinguishable from an abandoned one.

  Everything in this library up to here happens in weeks. This part
  happens over months or years, and it is where rewards crowdfunding
  actually fails: not usually in fraud, but in a creator who stops posting
  while backers cannot tell whether the project is late or dead. The
  design response is not a penalty. It is to make the DIFFERENCE
  observable — `stale?` is computed from the creator's own update cadence,
  and `accountability` reports obligations as facts rather than opinions,
  so a platform, a backer and the creator all read the same record.

  Two boundaries:

  - **Addresses are collected, not stored here.** A survey response
    carries a reference to where the address lives, never the address.
    This library is pure and gets copied into logs, ledgers and test
    fixtures; a shipping address in a pure domain value ends up in all
    three.
  - **Nothing here adjudicates.** `undeliverable` and `failure-disclosure`
    record what a creator or a named human stated. There is no function
    that decides a project failed.

  Pure: no clock (the caller passes `now`), no network."
