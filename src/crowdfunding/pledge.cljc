  "Pledge — a backer's commitment, and the state machine that separates
  'promised' from 'paid'.

  The single most consequential fact about rewards crowdfunding is that a
  pledge is an AUTHORIZATION, not a payment. Money is not taken when the
  backer clicks; it is taken (or not) after the deadline. Every field and
  every state here exists to keep those two moments distinguishable:

  - `:authorized` — the backer has committed. Nothing has been charged.
    A campaign's headline 'raised' number is made of these, which is why
    `crowdfunding.funding` and `crowdfunding.collection` report different
    totals and both are correct.
  - `:collected` — money actually arrived.
  - `:failed` → `:retrying` → `:dropped` — the payment did not go through.
    This path is not an edge case: on a large campaign a meaningful
    fraction of authorizations never become collections, and a system with
    no vocabulary for it will report a raise that never landed.
  - `:cancelled` — the backer withdrew, which they may do at any time
    before the funding window closes. That right is not a courtesy; it is
    the counterweight to being charged later for something not yet built.

  A pledge total is `tier minimum-or-more + add-ons + shipping`, all
  integer minor units of the campaign currency. Pure: no clock, no
  network, no randomness."

    happened.
  - anything out of `:dropped`. A dropped pledge is a backer the campaign
    lost; recovering them is a NEW pledge with a fresh authorization, not
    a resurrection of an expired one."
